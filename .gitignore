# No selection was made, and the entire code file appears to be a text description of a file structure. 

# Assuming the task is to create a basic .env file structure for a Backend application, here's a possible implementation:

DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password

# Please note that you should replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials..env
Backend/.env
